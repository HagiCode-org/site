## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Blog Infrastructure

**Reason**: The blog feature has been deprecated and removed from the Hagicode documentation site. The blog contained outdated content with incorrect technical information that was misleading users. Since the blog was not actively maintained and did not serve the core documentation mission, it was removed to simplify the site structure and reduce maintenance overhead.

**Migration**: No migration path provided. Blog content has been permanently deleted. Users who had bookmarked blog posts will receive 404 errors. If blog functionality is needed in the future, it can be re-added through the OpenSpec proposal process.
